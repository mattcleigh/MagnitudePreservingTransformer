# Magnitude Preserving Transformer

This repository contains a collection of scripts and configurations for training and testing homegrown NLP models.
The project is structured to facilitate experimentation with different configurations and datasets.
Mainly it is so I can play around with different normalisation or magnitude preserving techniques.
At the moment I am interested in a transformer that preserves the magnitude of all outputs in each layer.
Relevant papers:
 - nGPT: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01131v1.
 - Magnitude Preserving layers (EDM2): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02696.

Main ideas
- Make all linear layers magnitude preserving
 - Manually unit_norm weights after each SGD step
 - Manyallu unit_norm weights during foward pass (ensures gradients are orthogonal)
- Make the embedding magnitude preserving in the same way
- Remove all learnable affine transformations from rms norm
- Remove weight decay and learning rate warmup
- Use learnable magnitude preserving residual connections of the form:

$$x \leftarrow \frac{x + \alpha(F(RMSNorm(x) - x))}{\sqrt{(1-\alpha^2)} + \alpha^2}$$
 - Where F is either MP-SelfAttention or MP-Swiglu and \alpha is a learnable tensor akin to LayerScale


Initial tests show that the specially designed MP layers help the transformer to learn more efficiently without any weight decay!
- Pre-Norm transformers require strong weight decay (0.1) to ensure magnitude doesnt grow through layer
- I don't have access to the required compute for a proper GPT2 scale test :(

### Key Directories and Files

- **configs/**: Contains configuration files for experiments, Hydra, and training.
- **data/**: Directory for storing datasets.
- **outputs/**: Directory for storing output files and logs.
- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for running training and setup tasks.
- **src/**: Source code for data modules, models, and utilities.

## Usage

Right now the main functionality is just training the autoregressive model on either WikiText-103 or OpenWebText.
mainly for watching the loss go down or using the generate script to see inspect the quality.

### Data Preparation

To prepare the WikiText-103 dataset, run the `setup_wikitext.py` script:

```sh
python scripts/setup_wikitext.py
```

This script downloads, tokenizes, and saves the dataset in the `wikitext-103` directory.
This saves the dataset as numpy arrays which are only a couple of GB in size, and can be loaded wholly into memory.
The same can be done for OpenWebText but this takes quite long and requires ~50GB of HDD space.

### Training

To start training a model, run the `train.py` script located in the `scripts` directory:

```sh
python scripts/train.py
```
### Configuration

The project uses Hydra for managing configurations.
The main configuration file is located at `configs/train.yaml`.

You can override any configuration parameter from the command line.
For example, to change the seed and the precision, you can run:

```sh
python scripts/train.py seed=123 precision=high
```
Alternativel large collections of keys may be be overwritten by files in the `configs/experiment` directory.
Once created, they can be loaded using

```sh
python scripts/train.py experiment=new_file
```
